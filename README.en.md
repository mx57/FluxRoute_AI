> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is the original FluxRoute Desktop repository.**
> 
> All derivative projects (forks) are based on this code. GitHub automatically marks them with `forked from klondike0x/FluxRoute`.

**FluxRoute Desktop** is a modern GUI wrapper for managing [`Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube`](https://github.com/Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube) profiles with a unique **AI orchestrator** powered by Thompson Sampling and genetic strategy evolution.

Launch, update, and switch profiles from a single window — no manual BAT-file editing required.

> 🌍 **Note:** FluxRoute is part of the **zapret ecosystem** — a set of tools for DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) bypass, primarily used in CIS countries to access blocked services like YouTube, Discord, Instagram, and Telegram. The main community is Russian-speaking, but the tool itself works anywhere DPI-based filtering is used.

## 🆚 How FluxRoute differs from other GUIs

FluxRoute is the **only** GUI with a full-fledged AI subsystem:

| Category | FluxRoute | Zapret-Hub | Zapret-GUI | Zapret2 GUI | ZapretControl |
|----------|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| 🧠 AI Orchestrator (Thompson Sampling) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 🧬 Genetic strategy evolution | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 🎮 Process triggers (by .exe) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ⚙️ Auto-Tune (IPSet × GameFilter) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 📡 Built-in TG WS Proxy | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 🤖 AI DNS (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| 💬 Telegram Desktop unlock | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 📚 80+ built-in strategies | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| 🎨 Themes (5+) and i18n | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 📦 Portable + installer | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 🔒 GitHub Actions (transparent builds) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| 🔄 Atomic engine updates | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

> **Key difference:** FluxRoute is the only project where AI **autonomously selects and evolves** strategies for your network via Thompson Sampling and genetic algorithms. Other GUIs are convenient wrappers with static profiles or niche features (AI DNS, Telegram, mods).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements
- **Windows 10/11 x64**
- **Administrator privileges** (for `winws.exe` and WinDivert)

### Installation

1. Download the latest release: [**Releases**](https://github.com/klondike0x/FluxRoute/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP to any folder (e.g., `C:\FluxRoute\`)
3. Run `FluxRoute.exe` **as Administrator**
4. Wait for automatic `engine/` download from Flowseal
5. Select a profile and click **▶ Start**

### First Launch with AI

1. Update `engine/` on the **Updates** tab
2. Enable **AI mode** on the **AI** tab
3. Launch the **orchestrator** on the **Orchestrator** tab
4. Done — AI will automatically pick the best strategy for your network

---

## 🧠 AI Orchestrator

The unique `FluxRoute.AI` subsystem, not found in other GUIs:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Strategy Genome** | Typed strategy representation (filters, desync, split, fake TLS) |
| **Bandit Selector** | Strategy selection via Thompson Sampling with configurable exploration |
| **Strategy Evolver** | Crossover of top genomes by Wilson lower bound; parameter mutations |
| **Network Fingerprint** | Network signature (DNS, gateway, interfaces) — separate policy per network |
| **AiHistoryStore** | Probe log in `fluxroute-ai-history.jsonl` |
| **AiStrategyRegistry** | Genome registry, bandit state, generation counter |
| **BatMaterializer** | Writes evolved strategies to `engine/ai-evolved/*.bat` |

    style J fill:#2e2e2e,stroke:#888,color:#ccc
```

### Workflow

1. 🌐 **Network Fingerprint** — capture DNS, gateway, interfaces
2. 🎰 **Bandit Selector** — pick a strategy via Thompson Sampling
3. ⚡ **Apply BAT** — launch `winws.exe` with strategy parameters
4. 🔍 **Site Probes** — check availability of YouTube, Discord, etc.
5. 📊 **History + Wilson** — update success statistics
6. 🧬 **Evolution** — periodically crossover the best strategies
7. 📁 **`ai-evolved/`** — new BAT files are saved automatically

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For any issues, try:
> 1. Run as **Administrator**
> 2. Update `engine/` on the **Updates** tab
> 3. Run **Scan all profiles** on the **Orchestrator** tab
> 4. Enable **Auto-Tune** on the **Service** tab

### ❌ TG WS Proxy won't install (SSL error)

In networks with DPI blocking `python.org`, use **Firefox** for manual download:

1. Download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-embed-amd64.zip
2. Extract to `tg-proxy\python\`
3. In FluxRoute: **TG Proxy** tab → **Install TG WS Proxy**

**Starting with v1.5.1** — automatic fallback to `astral-sh` mirror (GitHub CDN).

### ❌ `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'proxy.pool'`

The old installer didn't fetch new files. Fix:

1. Download https://github.com/Flowseal/tg-ws-proxy/archive/main.zip
2. Copy the `proxy/` folder to `tg-proxy\proxy\`
3. Restart the proxy

**Starting with v1.5.1** — the installer downloads the entire repository as a ZIP archive.

### ❌ Profile not working (0%)

1. Ensure **GameFilter** = `TCP and UDP`
2. **IPSet Mode** = `loaded`
3. Run **Auto-Tune** on the **Service** tab
4. Check extended diagnostics (**Diagnostics** tab)

### ❌ Port 1443 is busy (TG Proxy)

```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :1443
taskkill /PID <number> /F
```

## ⚠️ WinDivert and Antivirus

> [!WARNING]
> The project uses **WinDivert** — a legitimate traffic interception tool required for zapret to work.
> 
> It is **not a virus** by itself, but antiviruses may classify it as `Not-a-virus:RiskTool.Multi.WinDivert` or `HackTool`.

**What to do:**

- Add the FluxRoute folder to your **antivirus exclusions**
- Disable **PUA** (Potentially Unwanted Application) detection
- In Kaspersky: uncheck *"Detect legal applications that attackers often use"*

---

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ **GitHub Actions** — all releases are built automatically and transparently
- ✅ **SHA-256 hashes** — every download is verified in the logs
- ✅ **Open source** — anyone can audit what the app does
- ✅ **No telemetry** — FluxRoute does not collect user data
- ✅ **Portable** — no installation required, runs from a folder
- ✅ **Atomic updates** — staging → backup → rollback on errors

> [!TIP]
> App updates always come only from the official `klondike0x/FluxRoute` repository — the URL is hardcoded in `AppUpdaterService`. This ensures that even fork users eventually receive the original version.
